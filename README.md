# Glass Jaw

Have you ever looked up from a long workday of stabbing yourself in your dragonscale chestplate,
foul RF getting all over your blood altar, and thought to yourself, "where did this all go wrong?"

Look no further, friend. I think I have just the thing for you.

This mod detects other mods which are hostile to absolute+unblockable damage, and deploys countermeasures. The
more they kick and scream, the meaner Glass Jaw gets. Every armor has a weakness. EVERY armor. In fact,
please submit an issue if you find damage mitigation I didn't catch.
